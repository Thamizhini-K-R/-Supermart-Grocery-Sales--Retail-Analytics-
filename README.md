Supermart Grocery Sales – Retail Analytics Project
This project involves analyzing sales data from a fictional supermarket in Tamil Nadu. The goal is to extract insights on sales performance and customer behavior using Python and machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset includes various details such as:

Invoice ID

Branch and City

Customer Type and Gender

Product Line

Unit Price and Quantity

Total and Tax

Payment Method

Date and Time of Purchase

Ratings

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Google Colab

Jupyter Notebook

Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Explore and visualize data trends

Analyze customer purchase behavior

Build a basic machine learning model to predict total purchase amount

Steps Followed
Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Cleaned the data and converted data types

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualized key metrics (sales by city, product line, payment methods)

Built a regression model to predict the total purchase amount

Evaluated model performance using R² and MAE metrics

How to Run
Clone the repository or upload the notebook and CSV file to Google Colab

Install required libraries (if not already available in Colab)

Run the notebook cells step by step

Results
Found highest and lowest selling product lines

Identified cities with maximum revenue

Built a linear regression model with decent accuracy

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how retail sales data can be used to extract actionable insights and build predictive models to support business decisions.
